# Overview:
<p>We built this web application with cutting edge technologies and rich UI/UX to solve the hassle of managing the supplies and make the entire supply management versatile. This application will integrate the suppliers, consumers and distributors data. This app is primarily built for enhancing packaged goods management, however this application can also be used in other similar cases. By integrating suppliers, consumers and distributors data management in a single portal, the efficiency of tracking and managing the supplies will increase multifold. Our system also enables tracking each transaction between different entities, with analytics. This application also handles purchase and sales returns. In addition to normal procuring and distribution of goods, other expenses too can be added, tracked and managed.</p>
